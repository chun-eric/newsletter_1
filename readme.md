<h1>Japan Bliss</h1>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>
A newsletter email I designed and coded for a fictional Japan travel newsletter that showcases different places to visit in Japan. The email is responsive and works on all email clients. I used HTML, CSS, and Photoshop to create the email and Email on Acid to test the email on different email clients.</p>
